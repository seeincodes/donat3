# CCIP Read Gateway

[Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) is used as the [CCIP Read](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668) gateway. [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) is used to store name data.

These choices allow for a scalable namespace with low cost (store up to 1M names for free), low latency, and high availability.

> [!NOTE]  
> Cloudflare D1 is in open alpha, so there is a possibility of breaking changes. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/gskril/ens-offchain-registrar/issues) if you encounter any issues.

## API Routes
